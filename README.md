Programming Assignment on Dueling DQN and Monte-Carlo REINFORCE algorithms for the environments CartPole-v1 and Acrobot-v1.

Find the final report for this assignment at [Report.pdf](Report.pdf).

Find the code for Dueling DQN algorithm at [Dueling_DQN.ipynb](Dueling_DQN.ipynb) and code for Monte-Carlo REINFORCE algorithm at [Reinforce.ipynb](Reinforce.ipynb).

Find the resulting learning curves in the [Plots](Plots) folder.
